# DExa
Decentralised examination process management application built for PEC hacks 2.0

Institutions or test-conducting agencies, regardless of their size or operational mode (public or private), can utilize this application to create and conduct computer-based exams. Typical problems such as question paper leakage, response tampering, and other disputes can be tracked and proven through DExa's web3 solution. The key point is that it maintains the familiar exam process and user interface/user experience while leveraging the power of web3 technology behind the scenes.
